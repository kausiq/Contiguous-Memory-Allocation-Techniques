First-Fit Allocation is a memory allocation technique used in operating systems to allocate memory to a process. In First-Fit, the operating system searches through the list of free blocks of memory, starting from the beginning of the list, until it finds a block that is large enough to accommodate the memory request from the process. Once a suitable block is found, the operating system splits the block into two parts: the portion that will be allocated to the process, and the remaining free block.
